# Arduino Based CNC Winder

## Introduction

This is a project I have worked on for a while. 

Around 2018 a good friend with a passion for audiophile-grade hardware was looking into building his own speaker coils. Having to wind a lot of coils by hand, he asked me if I could build a machine to do it for him. He already had a design in mind, starting from a clear acrylic lasercut frame and a couple of stepper motors.

I started working on the project, but it was soon put on hold due to other priorities. I might have also underestimated the complexity of the project, as I was still a bit of a noob at the time. Keep in mind that this was my first arduino project, and I had no idea what I was doing, I had to learn as I went.

Knowing what I know today I would probably add a couple of features like a display and a rotary encoder to control the wire gauge and the number of turns, but I think it's a good start. I might revisit this project in the future assuming my friend still keeps the thing around.
